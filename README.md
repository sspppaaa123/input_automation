4) armstrongop.txt , primeop.txt and names_searchop.txt are the files that have the correct outputs for the test inputs. These files are present in a folder called 'output_files' in directory.
5) inp.py is the script to write all the test input file names into input.txt (both files in directory)
6) out.py is the script to write all the correct output file names into output.txt (both files in directory)
7) auto2.py is the code for automation (in the directory)
  - It takes the test inputs.
  - Executes the codes with test inputs.
  - The corresponding outputs are stored int the files : output0.txt , output1.txt and output2.txt (for the sample 3 codes in alphabetical order) . These output files are stored in a folder named 'Op' which is again stored in the above mentioned directory.
  - If output0.txt and armstrongop.txt have same values, then it is said to be successful execution. Similarly, other files are also checked.
